# Hi, I'm Christine!

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Oregon State University (graduated March 2022). As a former Real Estate Analyst who decided to 
transition into more Software Development-oriented roles, I strive to continually learn and explore different approaches to solving complex problems.
